Math Functions I

	- to use common math functions, you must include <math.h>
	  header file and link to the math library

	- double acosh(x)

		+ returns the hyperbolic arccosine of x, x >= 1

	- double asin(x)

		+ returns the arcsine of x as an agle expressed
		  in radians in the range [-pi/2, pi/2]

		+ x is in the range [-1, 1]

	- double atan(x)

		+ returns the arctangent of x as an angle 
		  expressed in radians in the range [-pi/2, pi/2]

	- double ceil(x)

		+ returns the smallest integer value greater than
		  or equal to x

		+ note that the value is returned a sa double


Math Functions II

	- double cos(r)

		+ returns the cosine of r

	- double floor(x)

		+ returns the largest integer value less than or
		  equal to x

		+ note that the value is returned as a double 

	- double log(x)

		+ returns the natural logarithm of x, x >= 0

	- double nan(s)

		+ returns a NaN, if possible, according to the 
		  content specified by the string pointed to by
		  s

	- double pow(x, y)

		+ returns xy
	
		+ if x is less than zero, y must be an integer

		+ if x is equal to zero, y must be greater than
		  zero

	- double remainder(x, y)

		+ returns the remainder of x divided by y


Math Functions III

	- double round(x)

		+ returns the value of x rounded to the nearest
		  integer in floating-point format

		+ halfway values are always rounded away from 
		  zero (so 0.5 always rounds to 1.0)

	- double sin(r)

		+ returns the sine of r

	- double sqrt(x)

		+ returns the square root of x, x >= 0

	- double tan(r)

		+ returns the tangent of r

	- and so many more ...

		+ complex arithmetic
